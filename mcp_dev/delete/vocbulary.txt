When vcoabulary is deleted all terms in vocabulary need to removed and
the vocabulary itself. This will include all field, field values and references 
to terms inside the deleted vocabularies. Unlike deleting a term is safe
to say that all terms in the vocabulary will be deleted so nothing
special needs to be done there. The only thing special is getting a list
of all the term ids in the vocaulary so that any references to them can be removed. or
actually I don't even thing this is necessary because we can use joins instead. Also, permissions
for indvidual terms and vocabularies will actually need to be physically deleted from the system.
