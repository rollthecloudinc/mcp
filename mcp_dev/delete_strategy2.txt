purge – anything set to deleted = NULL is removed from db.

- purge will apply globally – if you have permission to pruge
  than you can run purge for everything on a site or we just
  make it purge everything - only developers will have this
  permission anyway. It is unlikely anything will ever need to purged
  by anyone other than an admin considering it will be hidden.
