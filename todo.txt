- Move dynamically generated navigation items without first editing and saving to concrete link
- Restrict access to view admin menu and perhaps separate links within admin menu itself
- Apply permissions to navigation links
- Integrate role based permissions into permission layer.
- Make it possible to sort dynamic fields that are arrays.
- Make it possible to add more dynamic fields to arrays preferable without reliance on JavaScript
- Implement configuration permission plugin
- Create UI to manage permissions
- Add validation handling to dynamic fields
- Create global diaolog, system messages for providing feedback to users when carrying out actions regarding
  success, failure or warnings that occurred or prevented something from happening.
- Develop algoritm to generate views and associated UI
- Rename VD to View
- Create cache layer for expensive, repetitive and recursive data access tasks such as; building
  vocabulary, menu, getting entity dybamic fields, etc.
- Create term management area similiar to navigation area for managing tree structure.
- Re-design navigation area breadcrumb system, its a bit awkward
- make sure view algorithm ignores deleted items automatically with tables supoorting soft delete
- account for default field values with view SQL builder algorithm
- add short-cut/magical type to assign field to system entities such as; site, user, node of type x
  ,node type, term of vocabulary x, vocabulary, etc. This can be done with the DAO call but
  really it needs to be easy to do though the DAO can be used the back-end to derive the values
  still. perhaps just hide the DAO for now in user interface.
  - dao arg multi-dimensional numeric and associative support
