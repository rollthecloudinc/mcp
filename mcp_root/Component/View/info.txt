The views component is inspired by Drupal views. It will effectively attempt
to recreate the functionality of views. One significant advantage will be
data will be stored accross mutiple tables in a proper normalized format
without serialization. In addition, views will be able to be used by any
entity within the system that has a schema defined. At least that is the intended 
goal.

Up to this point views has been partially implemented. Views function for
nodes and nothing else though yet. Also, there is not admin UI yet. The admin
UI has be built. However, if you enter data directly into the db properly the
functionality does exist for nodes.
